# Advent of Code 2019

Although the challenge has already ended, I thought I'd brush up on my programming skills by completing the 2019 incarnation of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).

In addition to solving the puzzles, I would also like to take this as an exercise in maintaining an organized project structure with clean, idiomatic code.
At a later time, I may come back and refactor my solutions for efficiency.

In this repository, files are grouped according to the days of the challenge, with each folder containing the following:
- `puzzle.md`: The puzzle description
- `puzzle_input.txt`: The unique input given to me for each puzzle
- `solution.py`: Solutions to the day's puzzle implemented in Python
- `test.py`: Code to test key functions written in `solution.py` using sample data given in the puzzle question.
